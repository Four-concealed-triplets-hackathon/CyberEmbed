## Overview

⚡CyberEmbed is a powerful tool which can help you to embed website content into a single image. When you want to share a link with others, you can use this tool to convert a bare link which contains little information to a awesome and beautiful image which contains lots of useful information such as title and brief description of the link you want to share. Of course, the generated image contains a QR code which links to the page you want to share.

⚡CyberEmbed supports the concept of "software as a service" (SAAS), and you can use our powerful tool by simply visiting our website ([online demo](http://yukiruuku.design/CyberEmbed_Web_exploded/index.jsp)) and entering the URL of the web page you want to share. And then, you can get the generated image and share it with your friends!

⚡CyberEmbed supports:
* Github <img src="./public/img/resources/github_logo.png" alt="github" width="30px"/>
* 知网 <img src="./public/img/resources/cnki.png" alt="twitter" width="30px"/>
* Steam <img src="./public/img/resources/steam.png" alt="steam" width="30px"/>

## Insight

Sometimes you want to share a web page or resource (i.e., a Github repository) with you friends, and you can only send the link (URL) of that resource to your friends. In that way, your friends will totally have no idea about what the resource is until they click the link and enter the web page. 

That's really inefficiency! This is because a URL can contain very little information (though it's better than IP address). 

To solve this problem and improve efficiency, we decide to develop CyberEmbed. With CyberEmbed, you can embed brief and main content of a website into a single image easily. For example, as to a Github repository, we will embed the title, author, description, star and fork number into the image. Sharing such an image with your friends, he or she can have a rough idea of what the resource is before entering the web page.

## Getting Started

1. Visiting our website ([https://yukiruuku.design/CyberEmbed_Web_exploded/index.jsp](http://yukiruuku.design/CyberEmbed_Web_exploded/index.jsp))
2. Entering the URL of the website you want to embed into an image
3. Previewing the image and download it
